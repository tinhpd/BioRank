**BioRank** enhances and expands their framework by providing:

- An intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that enables biomedical researchers to run analyses without coding
- Integration of **BioRank algorithms** for gene prioritization
- Evaluation and validation of prioritized genes against curated cancer knowledgebases such as **OncoKB**
- Exportable outputs and automated workflows for reproducibility and downstream analysis

## 📘 Introduction

Recent studies have shown that PageRank-based approaches can help identify disease-related genes from biological networks. However, traditional methods mainly rely on network topology and overlook vital biological factors such as gene expression, functional annotations, and similarity between gene pairs. In this study, we propose an Enhanced PageRank algorithm that integrates multi-omics data—including PPI networks, co-expression, gene ontology (GO, KEGG, Reactome), and differentially expressed genes—into a unified framework. By modifying the personalization vector and applying weighted diffusion, our method improves the ability to prioritize cancer-related genes more accurately than classical PageRank and other network propagation approaches.

## 🖥 Application Overview

**BioRank** is a Python-based GUI application built with Tkinter to enable biomedical researchers to:

- Run **Original** and **BioRank** for gene prioritization  
- Perform step-by-step **biological data preprocessing**  
- Integrate data from PPI, co-expression networks, and ontologies  
- Export ranked gene outputs  

The GUI includes:

- **Left Panel** – Run BioRank  
- **Right Panel** – Preprocessing functions (ontology, co-expression, TCGA parsing)
